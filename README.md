# Project Todos

Create a todo list using React and Redux.

## The problem

* Started looking for inspiration using Dribble and Pinterest.
* Sketch a prototype on Figma.
* Started building the redux store and connecting the store with the app component.
* Created all basic components like TaskList and Task. 
* Added more actions in reducers, like removeAll and addTask.
* Style the components using Styled Component.

If I had more time: I would like to export the different styled-components to separate files instead of it being in the same component. And I would like to add a category selector and filter through the different the category.
